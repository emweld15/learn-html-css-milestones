  <h1>This is the top H1!</h1>
  <p>I am coding this stuff and I am craving candy.  I really want Nerds the most (that was my first picture so that makes sense) but I would take a lot of other candy too.</p>
    <p>I like Laffey Taffey (the strawberry flavor the most and the banana flavor second most).</p>

      <h2>I also miss my puppy!!</h2>
      <p>I got a puppy over quarantine.  His name is Moose.</p>
      <p>He is really really cute.  Moose is a petite goldendoodle and he is one of my favorite things this world has to offer.</p>
